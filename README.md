# Physics-Simulations
# Physics Simulations in PyGame 2.5.0
I am experimenting with several different 2D physics simulations in PyGame, including projectile motion, collisions, and explosions.

The current implementation of physics.py is a 2d platformer that I plan to turn into a projectile motion simulation, with variable launch angle and velocity. 

## Instructions
- Ensure Python is downloaded on your device ([here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) with pip set up
- Install PyGame and NumPy
```
pip install pygame numpy
```

Clone this repo and run physics.py
